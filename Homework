This text file is for the homework assignment GIT Commits.

I wonder what I should put here...

I guess I can always have a conversation with myself.

Or not. I am going to record things that happen from now to this assignment's due date, which is tomorrow night before midnight.

I am going to go to the mall with my younger brother, his girlfriend, and some of her friends for a little while.

Taking them to a nerd store before said store shuts down while we are there.

I will be taking pictures to use as figure references in my sketchbook for my Survey Animation class.
